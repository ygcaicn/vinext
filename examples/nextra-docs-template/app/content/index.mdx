# Introduction

Welcome to Nextra! This is a basic docs template. You can use it as a starting point for your own project :)

## What is Nextra?

A **simple**, **powerful** and **flexible** site generation framework with everything you love from Next.js.

## Documentation

The documentation is available at [https://nextra.site](https://nextra.site).

## About This Port

This example demonstrates a Nextra-style documentation site running on **vinext** — a Vite plugin that reimplements the Next.js API surface. The original [nextra-docs-template](https://github.com/shuding/nextra-docs-template) has been adapted to use the App Router with MDX support via `@mdx-js/rollup`.

### What's Different

- Uses **Vite** instead of Next.js CLI
- Uses **App Router** instead of Pages Router
- MDX is compiled by `@mdx-js/rollup` instead of Nextra's webpack plugin
- The docs theme is a lightweight custom layout instead of `nextra-theme-docs`
- All `next/*` imports (Link, etc.) are shimmed by vinext
