## About Satori

[Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori) is also a library by Vercel that converts HTML and CSS to SVG, which powers `next/og` for generating Open Graph images.

It's a great example of the kind of tool that works well with documentation sites — you can generate dynamic social images for each page.
